a. The total length of string str = 18
b. w1 = "be" | w2 = "be" | w1.equals(w2) = true
c. The start index of string and the end index(exclusive) of word
d. The result is the false. 
	Reason: the w2, which is substring of str has the '\n' at the end of
	the string. therefore when comparing w1 and w2 with ==, the result is
	false. On the other hand, evoking equals method does not include '\n' in
	the comparison. 
e. int len = chars.length;
f. '+' means concatenating strings or variables to make a string
g. the output tells that strings in java are char arrays.
